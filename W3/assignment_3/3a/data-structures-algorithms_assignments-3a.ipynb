    "The following assignment will test your understanding of topics covered in the first four weeks of the course. This assignment **will count towards your grade** and should be submitted through Canvas by **07.10.2022 at 08:59 (CEST)**. You must work and submit in groups of three students. You can get at most 5 points for Assignment 3A, which is 5\\% of your final grade. Assignment 3B will be released next week. Please submit your notebooks for 3A and 3B together.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For submission, please rename your notebook as ```{first_student_id}_{second_student_id}_{third_student}_3A.ipynb```. For example, submission by students with student ID numbers *11760001*, *11760002* and *11760003* should have the filename ```11760001_11760002_11760003_3A.ipynb```.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will use a dataset on Regional Statistics provided from the Statistics Netherlands (CBS) [1]. The homepage for this data is [here](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/maatwerk/2019/31/kerncijfers-wijken-en-buurten-2019). The dataset provided is filtered and contains information about the total population, gender, different age groups and marital status of the residents for each municipality in the country for the year 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is provided to you as a CSV file (```kwb-2019.csv```). CSV files are text files that contain data 'delimited' by a character. When read by a program, these files can be easily converted into simple spreadsheets. CSV files can be opened with Microsoft Excel or Libreoffice Calc. Since CSV files are simple to load and do not require specialized commercial software for usage, they are extremely popular as a data-distribution format for tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE : When I talk about row numbers below, they start from 1 as you would generally see in spreadsheet software like Calc or Excel. Please do not forget that Python uses zero-based indexing (indices start from 0 instead of 1).\n",

    "In this example, you will use the ```csv``` library to load CSV files. For this exercise, the usage of data analysis packages like ```Pandas``` is prohibited. The usage of Numpy is acceptable.\n",

    "The following code has three main funcionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Load data from the given CSV data file. \n",

    "2. Separate the ```headers``` (first row of the data that contains the column names) and ```data``` that contains the subsequent rows with actual data.\n",
